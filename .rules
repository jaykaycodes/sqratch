## Core Values

Performance. UX & DX. Simplicity.

# Tech Stack

## Tauri

- This app is built with Tauri v2. Refer to the tauri docs for the latest on how to use Tauri. IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO REFER TO THE NEW V2 API.
- Use Bun as our main package manager and for running tauri commands and maintaining node modules. Also for scripting. Prefer Bun conventions and imports over older node ones.

## React

### General

- use `#/` to import anything from the root `src/` dir (not `@/`)
- always use the default synthetic `import React from 'react'` and react utilities as e.g. `React.useMemo` instead of importing `useMemo` from `'react'`.
- always import icons using `import Icons from '#/components/icons'` (they are lucide icons)

### Project Structure

- src/components - shared components that span multiple routes/features
- src/lib - shared libraries
- src/routes - tanstack router routes folder. files & dirs prefixed with `-` are ignored by router and used to store components & helpers for that route.
- src/stores - global state management

### Libraries

Always leverage libraries for common tasks. Recommend libraries when it will save time, for instance if implementing a table component, suggest TanStack Table.
