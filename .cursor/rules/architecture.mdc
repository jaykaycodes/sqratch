- Sqratch is a desktop sql database gui, a la Postico/Tableplus/Beekeeper Studio
- It's main goal is to be well-integrated inside modern web developers' stacks (deep integrations into VSCode, Drizzle, Prisma, CLI, their codebase, etc)
- This app is built with Tauri v2. Refer to the tauri docs (indexed via Cursor) for the latest on how to use Tauri.
- Use Bun as our main package manager and for running tauri commands and maintaining node modules. Also for scripting. Refer to Bun docs in Cursor for that too.
- Refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](mdc:src-tauri/DEVELOPMENT.md) for understanding how to add code in the `src-tauri/` backend. When we're done making big changes, let's be sure to update this file to reflect the new state of our architecture.
