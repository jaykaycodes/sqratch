- DO use comments to explain non-obvious things
- DONT use comments to explain something that is trivially understood by looking at the code
    - e.g. THIS IS UNNECESARRY: `// Gets a list of admin users ... function getAdminUsers(...) {...}`
- DO use NOTE, WARN, TODO, and FIXME in comments to highlight extra important comments (e.g. `// NOTE: this is a very important comment`)
- DO use minimal (but readable) syntax. Some examples:
    - omit curly braces for 1-line blocks in JS (`if (cond) return val`)
    - prefer anonymouse functions ()
- DO ask questions if you're not sure!
- DO use Bun for js package management and as our js runtime for scripting
